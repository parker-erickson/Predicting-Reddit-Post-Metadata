# Predicting-Reddit-Post-Metadata
A report on an original idea to see if its possible to predict the Subreddit that a post is in based on it's title and other metadata.

The report starts with a python script that pulls the data we need from Reddit's API.

the first part of the report goes over our idea to use Naive Bayes to predict the subreddit from the titles of posts in a pre-determined pool of subreddits.

the second part is a quick implementation of a Linear regression model to predict if the post contains a video in its contents.
